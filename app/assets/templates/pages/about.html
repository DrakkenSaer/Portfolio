      <h2>Ruby on Rails</h2>
      RoR (Ruby on Rails) is an extremely powerful backend language. Most of my programming experience has been with this language. I thoroughly enjoy its elegance and simplicity and strongly wish to pursue my career dealing with this coding language. Rails is used by some pretty major players in the web industry!

      <h2>jQuery</h2>
      jQuery is a JavaScript library which makes quick work of some normally very complicated tasks within JavaScript. I prefer to use jQuery over JavaScript whenever I can simply because of its community base, which continually improves upon pre-existing code to make it run faster and more efficiently.

      <h2>Bootstrap</h2>
      Bootstrap is a front-end CSS3 library developed by the awesome people at Twitter. I absolutely love using this front-end library simply because it allows me to continue working through the code on my website without having to worry about the smaller details. Bootstrap has a grid-system which I tend to make strong use of. I look forward for future developments of this library!

      <h2>AngularJS</h2>
      AngularJS (or sometimes referred to as Angular JavaScript), is a JavaScript framework designed to increase the scalability and responsiveness of websites. With new devices becoming more powerful and capable of handling massive processing loads at once, AngularJS takes most of the workload from the server, to the client. In a typical AngularJS-integrated application (and on this website too), the server would serve all views and assets in one request load. Display and rendering are left completely up to the client. As with how this website is setup, the only requests the browser typically makes to the server would be a data model call (edit, update, create, delete, etc).

      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      JavaScript is the backbone to many of the front-end frameworks that I use to create a more responsive flow with any given web application. JavaScript allows the client browser to perform special behaviour, whether this be adding specific motion to an image, rendering pages, or implementing an entire game on a page, JavaScript will always be useful in situations where web applications are involved.

      <h2>HTML5</h2>
      HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web. It was finalized, and published, on 28 October 2014 by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). This is the fifth revision of the HTML standard since the inception of the World Wide Web. The previous version, HTML 4, was standardized in 1997. Its core aims are to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices (web browsers, parsers, etc.). HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML.
